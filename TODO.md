# Electra 2.0

+ Add a component that checks if the current stack is empty or not called stack checker. Use these characters: ().
+ Add a way to comment the code. Something like ? This is a comment ?
+ Add a way to include other code files. Something like ?? filename.ec x:y. Includes the lines in range [x, y)in filename.ec.
+ Increase the stack size and add stack switcher component(s).  
+ Add unicode versions of cables and other components.
+ Make ConstantPusher and Input components seperated. Input components will be called Reader. This won't change how language works. It just makes more sense to keep them seperated.
+ Comment out the code in general
+ Greatly modify README.md
    + Explain how Electra 2.0 works including multiple stacks and each current having its own stackPtr
