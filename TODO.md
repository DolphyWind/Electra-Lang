# Electra 2.0

+ Add a component that instantly ends the program called bomb.
+ Add a component that checks if the current stack is empty or not.
+ Add a way to comment the code.
+ Add a way to include other code files.
+ Increase the stack size and add stack switcher component(s).  
I might increase the total stack count to 16 and add two components for switching the stacks.  
Also an argument called --stack-count for managing stack count would be great.
+ Add support for unicode characters. This might break the windows compatability though, because my every attempt of reading unicode from file on Windows failed.
+ Add unicode versions of cables.
