# What is Electra?

Electra is an [esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) where you code like an electrician. Electra is inspired by [AsciiDots](https://esolangs.org/wiki/AsciiDots). It uses instruction pointers that act like currents in electricity. [Here's](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Electra) the esolang wiki page if you are interested.  

# How to get electra?

If you are on Arch Linux or a Linux distribution that is based on Arch Linux, you can download Electra using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org). To download electra from AUR, install an AUR helper like `yay`. Then type the command below into the terminal to install Electra.

```bash
yay -S electra-git
```  
If you are on a Linux distribution that is not Arch Linux based, or using completely different operating system. Currently the only option to get Electra running on your system is building Electra from source. To build Electra from source, open up a terminal and follow the steps below.

## Building on Unix-Like Operating Systems

If you are on a Unix-Like operating system such as Linux, MacOS, BSD etc. To build electra from source, first, install git, cmake and make using your package manager. Then type these commands in a terminal

```bash
# Clone the repository and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/DolphyWind/Electra-Lang.git
cd Electra-Lang
# Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build
# Run cmake to generate build files
cmake .. 
# Build Electra with make.
make
# (Optional) Install Electra to your system
sudo make install
```

## Building on Windows

If you are on Windows, please install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) alongside a C++ compiler and add them to your PATH. MSVC is now supported. To build electra on Windows, follow the steps below.

```bash
# Clone the repository and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/DolphyWind/Electra-Lang.git
cd Electra-Lang
# Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build
# Run cmake to generate build files
cmake ..
# Build Electra 
cmake --build . --config="Release"
```

# How Electra works?
Electra has three main components: Currents, Generators and Components. Electra uses a list of 64 stacks of doubles for its memory management.
(This implementation has a command line argument that lets you change the stack count)

## **Currents**
Currents are instruction pointers in Electra. They all have a direction, a position, a stack that holds visited portals and a stack pointer.
A direction can take one of these eight values: East, Northeast, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, South, Southeast.
On each iteration of Electra's main loop, each current moves one step forward.
When a current touches a component, if the component supports a current coming from that direction,
component does its work and uses that current's stack pointer when doing stack manipulations.
A current can either be generated by a generator, or be cloned by other components.

## **Generators**
Generators generate currents at the beginning of an Electra program and become useless immediately.
They generate current based on the direction that they are facing. To make looping easier, generators also let currents flowing on them.
They support the direction in which they generate current and its opposite. (e.g. an east generator supports both east and west directions)

#### **Generator Types**
>**East Generator (>, →):** Generates a current with east direction.

>**West Generator (<, ←):** Generates a current with west direction.

>**North Generator (^, ↑):** Generates a current with north direction.

>**South Generator (v, ↓):** Generates a current with south direction.

>**Northeast Generator (↗):** Generates a current with northeast direction.

>**Northwest Generator (↖):** Generates a current with northwest direction.

>**Southwest Generator (↙):** Generates a current with southwest direction.

>**Southeast Generator (↘):** Generates a current with southeast direction.

>**Horizontal Bidirectional Generator (↔):** Generates two currents with east and west directions.

>**Vertical Bidirectional Generator (↕):** Generates two currents with north and south directions.

## **Components**
Components are the elements that give Electra its functionality.
Each component has its own job and can clone or kill existing currents.  
If a current flows into a component from an unsupported direction, that current gets killed.
But components can also kill a current after they've done their work.
If a current lives and the component supports directions that are different from the current's direction or its opposite, it gets cloned.
This will be explained better in the following section.

### **Cables**
Cables are used to transmit currents in Electra. Some cables also clone currents.

For example:

    >-----+-
          |

The regular four directional cable (+) has a current flowing from west and heading to east. It will create 2 more copies of that current with directions north and south.
The current with direction north will die in the next iteration.

#### **Cable Types**
>**Horizontal Cable (-):** Supports east and west directions. Simple cable for flowing current horizontally.

>**Vertical Cable (|):** Supports north and south directions. Simple cable for flowing current vertically.

>**Right Diagonal Cable (/, ╱):** Supports northeast and southwest directions. Simple cable for flowing current diagonally.

>**Left Diagonal Cable (\\, ╲):** Supports northwest and southeast directions. Simple cable for flowing current diagonally.

>**Regular Four Directional Cable (+, ┼):** Supports east, west, north and south directions. Can be used to change direction of a current or clone it.

>**Diagonal Four Directional Cable (X, ╳):** Supports northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest directions. Can be used to change direction of a current or clone it.

>**Eight Directional Cable (\*, ✱):** Supports all directions. Can be used to change direction of a current or clone it.

>**East One Directional Cable (}):** Only lets current flowing to east direction.

>**West One Directional Cable ({):** Only lets current flowing to west direction.

>**North One Directional Cable (n):** Only lets current flowing to north direction.

>**South One Directional Cable (U):** Only lets current flowing to south direction.

>**Other Cables (╰, └, ╯, ┘, ╭, ┌, ┐, ╮, ├ ,┤ ,┬ ,┴):** These cables are not special they just have no name. They flow current based on how they look like.

### **Printers**
Printers print the value on top of the stack. They can print a variable either as a number or as a character.

#### **Printer Types**
>**Number Printer (N):** Supports east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest and southeast directions. Pops the top value off the stack and prints it as number. If the stack is empty it does nothing.

>**Character Printer (P):** Supports east, northeast, north, northwest, west, and southwest directions. Pops the top value off the stack and prints it as a character. If the stack is empty it does nothing.

### **Arithmetical Units**
Arithmetical units let Electra do arithmetical calculations. If there are less than two values on the stack, they do nothing.

#### **Arithmetical Unit Types**
>**Adder (A):** Supports north, southwest and southeast directions. Pops two values off the stack and pushes `first+second` back. 

>**Subtracter (S):** Supports northeast, north, southwest and south directions. Pops two values off the stack and pushes `first-second` back. 

>**Multiplier (M):** Supports east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, south and southeast directions. Pops two values off the stack and pushes `first*second` back. 

>**Divider (Q):** Supports east, north, west, south and southeast directions. Pops two values off the stack and pushes `first/second` back. 

>**Modder (%):** Supports northeast and southwest directions. Pops two values off the stack and pushes `std::fmod(first, second)` back. 

### **Constant Adders (I, D)**
Constant adders adds a constant value to the value that is on top of the stack. 

#### **Constant Adder Types**
>**Increaser (I):** Supports north and south directions. Pops the top value off the stack and adds one to it. Then pushes the result back. It does nothing if the stack is empty.

>**Decreaser (D):** Supports east, north, northwest, west, southwest and south directions. Pops the top value off the stack and subtracts one from it. Then pushes the result back. It does nothing if the stack is empty.

### **Cloner (#)**
Cloner, clones the value on top of the stack. It supports east, north, west and south directions. It does nothing if the stack is empty.

### **Constant Pusher (O)**
Constant pusher, pushes a constant value to the stack. There is currently only one constant pusher and it pushes 0 to the stack. Supports all eight directions.

### **Readers**
Readers, read user's input.

#### **Reader Types** 
>**Number Reader (@):** Supports east, northeast, north, northwest, west, southwest and south directions. Takes an input from user as a number and pushes it onto the stack.

>**Character Reader (&):** Supports north, south, east, southeast and southwest directions. Takes an input from user as character and converts it to a number. Then pushes it onto the stack.

### **Swapper ($)**
Swapper, swaps the top two values on the stack. It supports north, south, northeast and southwest directions. There must be at least two values on the stack for swapper to work.

### **Conditional Units**
Conditional units, kill the current or let it flow based on the value on top of the stack. They do nothing if the stack is empty.

#### **Conditional Unit Types**
>**Equals Conditional Unit (]):** Supports north and south directions. Pops the top value off the stack. Lets the current flow if the top value is equals zero.

>**Not Equals Conditional Unit ([):** Supports north and south directions. Pops the top value off the stack. Lets the current flow if the top value is not equals zero.

>**Greater Than Conditional Unit (G):** Supports east, north, northwest, west, southwest, south and southeast directions. Pops the top value off the stack. Lets the current flow if the top value is greater than zero.

>**Not Greater Than Conditional Unit (g):** Supports northeast, north, northwest, southwest, south and southeast directions. Pops the top value off the stack. Lets the current flow if the top value is not greater than zero.

>**Less Than Conditional Unit (L):** Supports northwest, west, southwest, south and southeast directions. Pops the top value off the stack. Lets the current flow if the top value is less than zero.

>**Not Less Than Conditional Unit (l):** Supports north and south directions. Pops the top value off the stack. Lets the current flow if the top value is not less than zero.

### **Stack Checkers**
Stack checkers, check whether the current stack is empty or not. 

>**Regular Stack Checker( ( ):** Supports north and south directions. Lets the current flow if the stack is empty.

>**Inverted Stack Checker( ) ):** Supports north and south directions. Lets the current flow if the stack is not empty.

### **Stack Switchers**
Stack switchers move the current's stack pointer forwards or backwards. Some of them pops the top value and moves it to the next stack.

>**Forward Stack Switcher (F):** Supports east, northeast, north, northwest, west and southwest directions. Moves current's stack pointer forward. Does not move top value to the next stack.

>**Forward Moving Stack Switcher (f):** Supports east, northeast, north, west and south directions. Moves current's stack pointer forward. Does move top value to the next stack if stack is not empty.

>**Backward Stack Switcher (B):** Supports northeast, north, northwest, west, southwest, south and southeast directions. Moves current's stack pointer backward. Does not move top value to the next stack.

>**Backward Moving Stack Switcher (b):** Supports east, northwest, west, southwest, south and southeast directions. Moves current's stack pointer backward. Does move top value to the next stack if stack is not empty.

### **Keys**
Keys transform to the other components when they are activated. They will keep the current still until they are activated. To activate a key, a current must be touch the key from its activator directions. 

#### **Key Types**
>**Horizontal Key (~):** Supports east and west directions. Becomes a horizontal cable when activated. Gets activated when a current touches it from north or south directions.

>**Vertical Key (!):** Supports north and south directions. Becomes a vertical cable when activated. Gets activated when a current touches it from east and west directions.

### **Reverser (R)**
Supports north, east, northeast northwest, southwest and southeast directions. Reverser, reverses the entire stack.

### **Eraser (E)**
Supports all eight directions. Eraser, pops off the top value from the stack. 

### **Bomb (o)**
Supports all eight directions. Finishes the program execution.

### **Portals**
Every other character in Electra is considered a portal. Portals support all eight directions.
They are used for teleporting currents. When Electra reads the source code, it marks the first instance of a portal as the original portal.
When you flow a current to an unoriginal portal, the portal gets pushed to that current's visited portals stack, and the current gets teleported
to the original portal. Flowing a current to the original portal teleports the current back to the last visited portal and pops it off the stack.
If the stack is empty, flowing a current to the original portal does nothing. Think of them like functions in other programming languages.

# Examples 
Here are some example programs written in Electra:

### **Hello World!**
A program that prints the phrase "Hello World!" to the terminal screen.
```
    >O    +-+     +-+     +-+                                     Q-PO
     I    I I   #P+ I     I I                                     $  I
     I +MPO I   I   I     O I                                     I  I +P

     I I    I I     I   #P# QDDDDD#P+DDDO                         I  #M+
     I O    I I     I   I               I    #PDDDDDD#PDDDDDDDD#PDO    
     I |    I I     I   I               I    I
     #M+    +-+     I   I               I    I
                    ##PP+               $    I
                                        +MP#P+
```

### **truth-machine**
truth-machine, takes an input from user; halts if the input is zero, prints one indefinitely if the input is one. truth-machine is used to test any esolang (or any other programming languages) whether if it is capable of doing this four basic operations:
1. Input
2. Output
3. Looping
4. Termination
```
    >@
    
    +->--#N+
    |      |
    |      #
    |      [
    +------+
```

### **FizzBuzz** 
A FizzBuzz program, starts to loop from 1 to N. For each number; prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, prints "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, prints "FizzBuzz" if the number is both divisible by 3 and 5. Prints the number if the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5.
